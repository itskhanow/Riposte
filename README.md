# Riposte
A Discord bot that keeps track of reposts.

Riposte keeps track of when users post links and if that link is posted into the same channel by someone else Riposte gently reminds them of their scrub status (While providing a link to the original post). It also keeps track of how many times a user totally styled on 'em in all the channels that Riposte has been added to.
